What is the difference between add, commit, and push?

Add: to select and add the modified files to the queue that can be committed later on. So, files are not yet committed.

Commit: to commit the modified files that have been added and created log already, so as to have a record.

Push: to push the changes to the remote repository and share to other people using the same repository.
